    <h3>Add pictures</h3>
    
    <p>
    To add pictures to your PhotoFilmStrip you can use the entry in the main menu (Tools -> Import pictures), 
    the toolbutton in the toolbar or by dropping some file in the imagelist at the bottom of the main window.
    </p>

    <h3>Motion control</h3>
    
    <p>
    After selecting a picture you see it once on the left hand side and once on the right hand side. 
    Now you can move a rectange on both pictures. To zoom the rectangle simply use the mousewheel. 
    Move it by dragging it with the mouse. 
    The rectangle on the left picture defines where the animated path of the picture starts. 
    The ending point is defined with the rectangle on the right picture.
    </p>

    <a name="settings"></a>
    <h3>Settings</h3>
    
    <p>
    Below the two images you can see a panel to adjust some settings for the selected picture. 
    It is possible to rotate it clockwise and counter clockwise. 
    You have the choice between some nice effects like black and white etc.
    Furthermore you can type in a comment to the picture. These comments will be generated into a subtitle file. 
    This allows you to easily turn on/off the comments while playing your PhotoFilmStrip on a DVD-Player or with your favorite software player.
